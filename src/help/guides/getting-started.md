## Allowing the app to send docs to your Kindle
The be able to recive mangas you'll need to authorize the app in [Amazon](https://m2k.wf/amz), you can follow this [link](https://m2k.wf/myx) to go directly to the site or you can search in your [Amazon's Account](https://m2k.wf/amh) for [Content and Devices](https://m2k.wf/myx).  
If you follow the link it will send you to the **.com** page, if it's not your usual page it will show you a message like this one:

![amazon_content_&_devices_message](/assets/media/amz_myx_msg-en.png)  
Just click and it will send you to the same page in your local Amazon.

In that pages we are searching for the **Preferences** tab:  
![amazon_content_&_devices_preferences_tab](/assets/media/amz_myx_tabs-es.png)  

Now we are going to scroll down to **Personal Documents Settings**,
![amazon_content_&_devices_personal_docs_config](/assets/media/amz_myx_personal_docs_config-es.png)  
in this section we can change our Kindle email or authorize an email address to send documents to our Kindle, that's what we want to do!  

So we are going to cick on **Add a new authorized e-mail** and write in the field the *Manga2Kindle* mail: **manga2kindle@m2k.wf**  
![amazon_content_&_devices_authorize_email](/assets/media/amz_myx_auth_mail-es.png)

## Find my Kindle email in the device
Let's click first in **Settings** in the top bar, then we can go to **All Settings**  
![kindle_main_menu](/assets/media/kindle_main_menu.png)  

In here we can change all our device settings but we are only searching for the email so we click in **Your Account**  
![kindle_settings_menu](/assets/media/kindle_settings_menu.png)  

And finally, at the **Send-to-Kindle Email** (at the very bottom), we can see the device's email address

Now we can put the email in the app.
