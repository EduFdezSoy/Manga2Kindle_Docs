# Find my Kindle email in the device
Let's click first in **Settings** in the top bar, then we can go to **All Settings**  
![kindle_main_menu](/assets/media/kindle_main_menu.png)  

In here we can change all our device settings but we are only searching for the email so we click in **Your Account**  
![kindle_settings_menu](/assets/media/kindle_settings_menu.png)  

And finally, at the **Send-to-Kindle Email** (at the very bottom), we can see the device's email address
![kindle_account_menu](/assets/media/kindle_account_menu.png)  

Now we can put the email in the app.
